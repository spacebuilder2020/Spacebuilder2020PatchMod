  <Description>[h1]Spacebuilder2020's PatchMod[/h1]
    [b]WARNING:[/b] This is a StationeersLaunchPad Plugin Mod. It requires Bepinex to be installed with the StationeersLaunchPad plugin.
    See: https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad
    
    Multiple Patches including:

    Patches connections to prevent a timeout when a client is kicked at initial connection. (Invalid password, blacklisting, invalid version).
    
    Extends Kick command so that a player name can be specified instead of a steamid.
      Requires exact name, if name is not exact, will try to find possible options and print them out.
      Also fixes vanilla kick to work with longer ids or disconnected steam ids
    
    Fix the decay time method to use the max damage value instead of hardcoding 100.
      Reason:  by default, the max damage value is set to 200 when items are initialized.  Thus, when an items time to decay is shown, it is inaccurate.
      Note: This patch will only apply on version `0.2.5959.26190` and before since this patch is in vanilla for newer versions
