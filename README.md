# [Spacebuilder2020's Patch Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3552686002)
This is a bug fix mod.  It may contain slight improvements for some features (i.e. kick command), 
 but for the most part, it just fixes existing logic that is broken in the base game.
 If this logic is eventually fixed, said patches will be removed in future versions.

    Multiple Patches including:

    Patches connections to prevent a timeout when a client is kicked at initial connection. (Invalid password, blacklisting, invalid version).
    
    Extends Kick command so that a player name can be specified instead of a steamid.
      Requires exact name, if name is not exact, will try to find possible options and print them out.

    Fix the decay time method to use the max damage value instead of hardcoding 100.
      Reason:  by default, the max damage value is set to 200 when items are initialized.  Thus, when an items time to decay is shown, it is inaccurate.
      Note: This patch will only apply on version `0.2.5959.26190` and before since this patch is in vanilla for newer versions
